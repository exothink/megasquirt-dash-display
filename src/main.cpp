 5-inch MEGASQUIRT ECU CANBus Dashboard Display
 proof of concept

 This project in current form "works", but is rough around the edges.
 It needs a nicer method of screen configuration, and a LOT of optimisation.

 This project is based around:
 - NodeMCU-32s ESP32 (WROOM-32) module
    https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nodemcu32s
 - Crystalfontz 800x480 TFT with Graphic Accelerator Board
    https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfaf800480e0050sca11-accelerated-tft-lcd-display-kit
 - Crystalfontz CFA10098 breakout board
    https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfa10098-eve-breakout-board
 - WS2812b LEDs (aka Neopixels)
 	https://www.amazon.com/s?k=neopixel+8+stick
 - Any MC2551 CAN bus Tranciever Module setup for 5V
    https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mcp2551+module
 - Any 5V 2-amp (or higher) regulator suitable for automotive use

 I programmed this in the PlatformIO development environment.
 The Arduino IDE could be used with some minor modifications.
 PlatformIO needs to have the NodeMCU-32s board support (using Arduino framework)
 installed.
